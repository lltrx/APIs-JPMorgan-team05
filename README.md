# Current Temperature of Capital Cities Around the World

This project uses the [RESTCountries](https://restcountries.com/) and [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api) APIs,
along with GeoPandas, to generate a world map of the capital cities of the world and their current temperature.

Requirements can be found in `requirements.txt`, please also generate an OpenWeather API key and paste it into the top of
the `main.py` file.

When the script is run it generates a `map.svg` output showing the result, and also displays the map as a plot.
